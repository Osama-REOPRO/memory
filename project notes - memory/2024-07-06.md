- [x] check if that edit I made to the cache to detect if it is fully associative was wrong
- [x] write prints to clearly demonstrate what is happening
- [x] it appears that [[valToWrite]] for L2 and phy and vir are never updated, why?
	- that makes sense because there is only one value that is being manually incremented, the other caches only get data from lower caches, never written manually
	- so I removed all the other copies of [[valToWrite]] as only one is needed (it was an array like others)
