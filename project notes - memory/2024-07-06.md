- [ ] after data is written to physical and it is filled, it begins to behave really weird, data going away then coming back, old data showing up, only the first 2 sets changing values, not sure what is happening
	- the smaller number you see aren't old data, that is actually the data warping around, remember that we are writing numbers per byte, a byte is 8-bits thus can store up to the number 256, after that it will warp around, that is normal not a problem
	- but still I think the behavior is weird, I would expect the oldest data to be written to the ram at first but actually new data gets written, that is wrong
- [ ] check if that edit I made to the cache to detect if it is fully associative was wrong
- [ ] write prints to clearly demonstrate what is happening
- [x] it appears that [[valToWrite]] for L2 and phy and vir are never updated, why?
	- that makes sense because there is only one value that is being manually incremented, the other caches only get data from lower caches, never written manually
	- so I removed all the other copies of [[valToWrite]] as only one is needed (it was an array like others)
