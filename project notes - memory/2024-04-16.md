- [ ] implement [[write back]] policy for writing
	- In a write-back cache, a dirty bit (D) is associated with each cache block. D is 1 when the cache block has been written and 0 otherwise. Dirty cache blocks are written back to main memory only when they are evicted from the cache.

	- In a write-back cache, a dirty bit (D) is associated with each cache block. D is 1 when the cache block has been written and 0 otherwise. Dirty cache blocks are written back to main memory only when they are evicted from the cache.
- [[(decision)]] our cache bits will have valid bit (V)
	- Sometimes, such as when the computer first starts up, the cache sets contain no data at all. The cache uses a valid bit for each set to indicate whether the set holds meaningful data. If the valid bit is 0, the contents are meaningless.
- [[(decision)]] our cache bits will have use bit (U)
	- In a two-way set associative cache, a use bit, U, indicates which way within a set was least recently used. Each time one of the ways is used, U is adjusted to indicate the other way. For set associative caches with more than two ways, tracking the least recently used way becomes complicated. To simplify the problem, the ways are often divided into two groups and U indicates which group of ways was least recently used. Upon replacement, the new block replaces a random block within the least recently used group. Such a policy is called pseudo-LRU and is good enough in practice.
- [[(decision)]] status bits will be organized as such
	- ![[Pasted image 20240416145352.png]]
	- each set has a single [[use bit (U)]] but each way inside it has it's own [[valid bit (V)]] 
	 - The order should be probably `UVD`
		 - Because the `U` is for multiple items (one per set) it should be at the outside, whereas `V` and `D` are one for each data block
