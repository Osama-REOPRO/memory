- initially I will simply write and read from the lowest level cache, it should work exactly the same as before except now it will evacuate values to the higher level cache instead of just discarding them

# Cache hierarchy [[(decision)]]s

- L1 will be directly mapped, while L2 will be 4-way set associative
- L1 will have block size 1, while L2 will have larger block sizes
- L1 will have small capacity, while L2 will have larger capacity
#### Notes
- these are typical values for most caches
- no need for L3 as that one is usually for multi-core systems to be shared between the different cores
