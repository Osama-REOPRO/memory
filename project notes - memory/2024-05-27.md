# Cache hierarchy [[(decision)]]s

- L1 will be directly mapped, while L2 will be 4-way set associative
- L1 will have block size 1, while L2 will have larger block sizes
- L1 will have small capacity, while L2 will have larger capacity
#### Notes
- these are typical values for most caches
- no need for L3 as that one is usually for multi-core systems to be shared between the different cores
