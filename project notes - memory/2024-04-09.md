- [[(decision)]] for a [[read operation]], all caches will be operated at the same time, in parallel, whichever one hits first is the one that returns the value
	- this might not be the most power efficient way of doing it, but it is the fastest
	- if no hit, retreat to [[virtual memory]]
- [[(decision)]] the instant we get a hit from any cache, all other caches are disabled (no [[memory operation]])
	- This would likely conserve energy and might reduce errors (or increase them, not sure)
