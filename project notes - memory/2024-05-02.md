- on write miss
	- if conflict, and not dirty, replace
	- if conflict and dirty, evacuate, then write
- seems like an evacuation on write is different than an evacuation on read
	- because on read, we evacuate and write the new missed data
	- on write, we evacuate and write the data evacuated from below
- a read order with an evacuation signal is different than a write order
	- the evacuation signals simply gives the intent for an evacuation
- on read signal
	- lowest level miss and conflict and dirty, issue read to higher level with evacuation flag
	- higher level miss and conflict and dirty, issue read to higher level with evacuation flag
	- highest level hit, broadcast data to all
	- all levels that missed and can read new data read it (no conflict or conflict and not dirty)
	- all levels that need evacuations evacuate bottom to top
		- lowest level starts write order with evacuation flag
		- higher level conflict, relays signal through itself
		- on done, higher level initiates it's own write order with evacuation flag
- always broadcast something that can be done
	- so if I get a read request, and miss with conflict so need evacuation, I set myself to evacuation mode with the data that needs to be evacuated on the ready and await done signal
- [ ] implement the logic I thought of yesterday
- the model of cycle/ack won't work
	- I need to relay more information than that
	- that works only if things could be resolved bottom to top then top to bottom, never skipping any level, orders coming from bottom and resolved at top
	- but this isn't how we order things now, data needs to be communicated both ways
- procedure
	- read checks upward until hit
	- write all that don't need evac
	- evac
	- write all evac
- how about not only relay messages forward, but backwards as well!
	- on finally hit, when we are writing all that don't need evac, we read top to bottom
	- those that need evac, relay the message downwards, allowing those in bottom to read
- [ ] implement the 3 stages
- things that propagate forward make themselves transparent so that what the element after them reports goes back to the beginning
	- propagation is an element getting out of the way, letting the signals of another go through itself
- treat the chain of caches like one unit
	- orders are given to the first element in the chain, it relays those to the next, then reports done when done
	- orders
		- read
			- propagates upwards
			- used at beginning of read operations
			- done when hit detected
		- evacuate
			- propagates upwards
			- used if conflicts occur
		- write all
			- propagates upwards
			- used to write missing data when reading
		- write
			- does not propagate
			- evacuates if needed
			- used for write operations
- cache operations queue
	- each cache can queue up operations like (read missing, evacuate, etc.)
	- we always go lowest to highest, so each cache, before it does what it needs to do must wait for the cache below it to inform it that it is done
	- last cache is always fed a "done"
	- the lowest cache that isn't done initiates operations
	- caches have a "done" input from lower level cache, we don't initiate operations unless lower is "done", if not, they should initiate, and we follow
	- we also have an "all done" input fed to all caches but only the lowest not done cache responds to to initiate operations
- read operation
	- first cache read order, miss, out of way, not done signal (which means done for current stage but still need stuff in next stages)
	- order transparently relayed to next cache, but with "not done" signal
	- once one hits the stage "get data" ends
	- on hit the lowest cache not done initiates next stage
		- it knows it is lowest because it's lower input is "done"
		- might this cause problems if a cache in the middle has a "done" but there is a cache that isn't done even before it?
			- first cache not done monitors the "all done" so it can initiate next step
- if we are going to relay stuff transparently, then maybe we don't need all those "done" signals between caches, we simply give the order to the first cache and if it is indeed done then it will simply act transparent and the order will naturally be relayed to the next cache, when that one is done with this stage it too turns transparent until we reach the end, at the end
	- once we move to the next stage, we feed the order to the first cache, again, if it is done it acts transparent
	- we might actually need the "done" signal after all, for the evacuations, because not only do we need caches lower to be transparent, but we also need caches upper to act transparent temporarily until we are done
- so we have two types of propagation: falling through and picking
	- falling through is when all are opaque then get transparent one by one lowest upward
		- so you have transparency on one side and opaqueness on the other
	- picking is when one becomes opaque and all others become transparent
		- so before it and after it all are transparent
		- so the inputs get to it and it's output gets to the end
		- maybe not all others, perhaps you make two of them opaque and what is between transparent, so you create a connection through them
		- picking is when all are transparent then those that aren't done get opaque progressively bottom to top, when one becomes opaque, all others become transparent to allow the signal forwards and backwards
		- this can be used when writing back, evacuating data, starting at the bottom, the first cache that needs to evacuate is made transparent, it then looks at the cache above it, if that cache has space for both the evacuated data and the data to be written, then we make that cache opaque and write to it, else we make it transparent and move to the next
- transparency should be both ways so that at the end where we place static "done" signal, once the last cache gets transparent that signal goes back to the beginning, that is the "all done" signal, once all the caches are transparent, the "all done" signal can finally go through all the caches to the beginning where it is detected
	- so caches do have a "done" input from higher level and output to the lower level, but they don't activate it internally, they only let the signal through or not, when opaque, it is held at "not done", when transparent, not held at anything, relay the input to the output, whatever it is, done or not done
