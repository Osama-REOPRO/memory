- [ ] add `lowest` and `highest` signals that tell the caches which one is the first one and last one
	- the `lowest` signal is input into the lowest cache, that cache will have an output also called `lowest`
	- when the cache is transparent, the `lowest` signal passes through it to the next cache
	- so this way, the cache that is lowest right now knows itself
	- likewise for highest
- [[(code note)]] `#note0002`
	- here we don't stand aside and become transparent, here we actually evacuate to higher level to free space and receive the new data, because the data we are receiving is newer
	- in the other cases we didn't do this because we would later receive even newer data, so we let a higher level receive this older data
	- but in this case we aren't receiving anything else, so we actually free up space to receive the data
- [ ] make simplest version without any of the optimizations I am thinking of, just to get a baseline for what is doable and what the challenges are
- [ ] make sure all resets are there
- [x] check that mem module is connected correctly
- [x] check that all modules are connected correctly with each other
- [x] check that cache sets and directions etc. are initialized correctly with the parameters
- [ ] solve the errors when we elaborate the design in vivado
