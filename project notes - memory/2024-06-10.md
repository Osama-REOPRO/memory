- [ ] finish writing the higher evac behavior (marked as todo comments)
- shouldn't [[block size]] between the 2 levels be the same?
	- no but what needs to change is the filling operation, now when you evacuate something from a lower to a higher level, if the higher level has larger blocks, you should fill the missing ones from physical memory or virtual memory, because the whole block needs to be valid all at once
- [ ] evacuation is happening right over the previous value rather than in an appropriate address
	- I suspect this has something to do with [[block size]]
- [x] where is the address being set?
	- the address only get's updated when we increment it, and it never gets updated for the 2nd level
- [x] update the address for the second level as well
	- updated but problems still there
	- right now moving between blocks is fine, but movement among words in the same block isn't working
- [x] probably the problem is that I am not updating the valid bits according to the address
- [x] how to determine subset of bits to write to from address
- [ ] the problem is in `write_data`
