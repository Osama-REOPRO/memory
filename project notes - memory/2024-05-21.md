- honing in on a specific address will be the job of the controller not the cache itself
- essentially the cache module is a nice wrapper around raw memory arrays, it just handles all the knarly memory business inside, but it attempts to make absolutely no judgement on what can or can't be done, it is just raw memory abstracted and should behave as such
- but this way it seems like lower bits of the address are meaningless, this way the only address we need is the set address in addition to which bytes are active, other than that is unnecessary, I suppose the controller can handle mapping a specific address to a set address and valid bit
	- so I suppose I could for now just ignore the lower parts of the address, no need to remove them entirely, I might need them later
- [x] reading and writing addresses are still messed up
