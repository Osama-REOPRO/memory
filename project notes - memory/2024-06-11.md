# Thoughts on cache input size
- reads/writes should be word aligned
	- so even though the address is a byte-address, we only care about the word part
- [[the single byte address, multi-byte input conundrum]]
- how about designing things simply to accelerate the system we do have
	- so we look at what kinds of accesses are required by this memory and design it to be fast with those
	- right now the only kind of access that I have is the one where a miss occurs and I need to fill the memory
	- I do the filling one block at a time, thus I should be able to do whole block reads
	- I also saw that there are assembly instructions for a word load and for byte loads, those should be fast as well
# Don't confuse internal sizes for external access sizes
- that is perhaps internally the block size is 8, but the outside world might not be able to access all of that at once, perhaps the outside world can access 4 words at a time
- the access sizes should be determined by what the memory is connected to, that it, it is determined externally not internally
- so if a lower level needs a 4 word access, this this one should have a ready input for that
# Access sizes are determined by internal and external considerations
- you create input sizes appropriate to what the cache is connected to (external consideration)
	- if a lower cache requires whole word refills then the upper cache should be able to read/write (access) a whole word at once
- you create input sizes appropriate to the internal organization of the cache (internal consideration)
	- so if you organize your cache internally into blocks of 4 words, you likely should be able to read/write those all at once, so that you could quickly refill them
# So it will have 4 access types: byte, word, block internal and block external
- these can be done in parallel, that is, a word access can write all 4 bytes at once
- this way all parts of the address can be meaningful, if we are writing a single byte, then the whole thing is meaningful, for a word write some of the bits are meaningful because all operations must be word aligned, etc.
# Exponential access size
- to make things simpler, I will implement an access size input, it is exponential meaning we can only input bytes, words, and blocks etc but not the nasty numbers in between, and word/block aligned, meaning that the larger it is the more bits in the address that you ignore
- remember that block sizes must be powers of 2, so this makes sense
- so if the access size is 2, that means you want `2^2=4` bytes written thus a word write
- my problem with this is that it includes the size 1, which means I would have to write 2-bytes, this makes no sense, what if the address is that of the last byte in a word, will I overflow that word then to the next word? I faced this before and it wasn't pretty
	- can I just ignore this? this doesn't feel clean, but I guess I have no choice
	- the benefits outweigh the negatives I guess
- this also simplifies the implementation because now I can use that input size as the number of bits to ignore in the address, if it is 0 then we don't ignore anything, if it is 2 then we ignore the least 2 bytes because we are doing a word access etc. this is really handy and useful
- this size can't exceed internal block size, because that will be the size of the input, can't do larger than that
# Implementation
- block size can be anything larger than that of lower level
- data is always provided in the input aligned with it's beginning, so if you are writing a single byte, the first byte in the input is taken into account, same for first word etc.
