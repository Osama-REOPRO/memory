- I am switching back to [[inclusive policy]]
	- god I hope I don't regret this
- [ ]  why don't I disregard [[valid_bytes]] while reading? that was clearly for writing, it makes no sense for reading
- [ ] handle clean and dirty
	- [ ] when clean, no need to read for evac, just overwrite the clean data, because now we are inclusive, the data is already in upper level
- [ ] the address translation between L1 and L2 determining which part of L2 read value to write to L1 (this address translation thing is driving me insane)
