- [[postmortem]] The mistake I made is that I tried to go abstract before even knowing what to abstract, should have made a manual version before trying to make it scalable
	- I mean making a manual version is complicated enough, making a scalable version is much more complicated, and add on top of that that I had never made a cache before! this was a fatal combination, no wonder my head was spinning thinking about all the possible combinations
	- Before you create a scalable version, you should have made increasingly large versions, that way you can start to see the patterns, and when you get to the scalable version you have something to reference so your head doesn't go spinning in a void because you have no solid rock to stand on
	- perhaps you start with a fully manual version, then in the next version you make a few things scalable, then in the next you make a few more things more scalable and so on, so you ease yourself into it rather than diving headfirst
	- that's why that very ambitious first version failed spectacularly and wasted so much time
