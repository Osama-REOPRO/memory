- with an associativity of 2, the random number generation should not be used, that is used only for above 2, the use bit is enough
- [[use_mem]] is being inverted on each write, how does that make any sense? what if we are writing to the same direction multiple times, the use mem will keep getting inverted for no reason
	- isn't the point of the use mem to point to the least-recently used mem direction?
	- the point was that we divide all directions into 2 halves, and then simply switch between them on each conflict
	- I think how I approached it was that I divided it into odd and even numbered directions, so then by toggling the least significant bit on each write we switch between odd-even each time
		- I think the problem here is that I am not setting the use bit but rather toggling it on each write, this means that it isn't pointing to the least recently used half but rather just switching halves each time, that makes no sense, what if I write twice to odd addresses?
		- [ ] I should instead set the use variable based on if the current address is odd or even
