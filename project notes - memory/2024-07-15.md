- universal stages
	- you lookup what needs to be looked up in all levels, then read what needs to be read from all levels, then write what needs to be written to all levels
	- Lookup stage
		- lookup data to be read or written until hit
		- after hit, repeat lookup for any data that needs to be evacuated
	- read stage
		- read what needs to be read for read op or for evac
		- loop until all data is read
	- write stage
		- write what needs to be written for write op or evac
		- keep writing until all data is written
- [ ] remove virtual and physical, just need interactions with virtual which could be represented by a cache externally that is put in the test bench
	- this should vastly simply everything and speed up things
- [ ] implement universal stages
- lookup by need
	- lookup first level, if miss > lookup upper necessary
	- no space for missing value > evac needed
	- go to upper layer
	- value miss > lookup higher needed
	- if lower needs evac, no empty available > evac needed
