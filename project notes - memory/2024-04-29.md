- [[(decision)]] [[inclusive policy]] or [[exclusive policy]] (**final decision is [[inclusive policy]]**)
	- [[inclusive policy]]
		- this reduces usage of higher caches, it shields them from it
	- [[exclusive policy]]
		- because [[inclusive policy]]'s benefits are more for multi-core systems, while ours is a single core
		- it can have a higher hit rate due to being larger
		- the biggest draw for me though is that it is simpler, no dirty bit and no back invalidation
			- but still I feel like this is quite wasteful
			- especially when memory fills up, hit penalty becomes quite high
	- final decision: [[inclusive policy]] for now, because it seems simpler and I already put in the dirty bit, adding [[exclusive policy]] later will be easier this way, because no new bits need to be added
	- maybe implement both? it is a learning experience after all, I might want to benchmark a whole bunch of different combinations and setups, they already seem quite similar in their operation
- [[write operation]] with [[inclusive policy]]
	- write to all cache levels at same time
	- before you write to a cache, do a [[hit check]], write to hit location if hit, to avoid duplication, if miss write wherever you want
	- don't write 
	- [[hit check]] lowest cache, then upwards
		- to avoid duplication of data
- [[suggestion]] we could have a 3 level cache, 2 main levels and a [[victim cache]] that is exclusive of the main levels and fully associative
- [ ] change implementation so that it adheres to [[inclusive policy]]
