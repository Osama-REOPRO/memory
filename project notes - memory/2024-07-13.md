- will utilize same write logic when read miss occurs
- on read misses, missed data will be written to the lowest cache, utilizing that same write behavior
- what happens if data is found on a higher level of cache?
	- it gets written down to the lowest level and the existing data is removed (set to invalid)
- how do the higher levels know to return control to the read instead of the write which is what they currently do without much changes?
	- no need
	- we lookup level after level, when the data is found it is returned immediately but the done signal isn't emitted, we then proceed to write that data to the lowest level, which is a normal write operation, then once that is done we then emit the done signal
- Process when we miss
	- lookup level after level until found
	- return that value
	- write that value to the lowest cache
	- emit done signal
- this is elegant because the write already emits the done signal when it is done, so not much needs to be refactored
- a problem remains which is that when we are writing the missing data, the write data needs to be changed, the write states only accept write data directly from the input
