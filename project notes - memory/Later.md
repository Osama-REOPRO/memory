- [ ] add delay to [[cach hit]], we can't figure out that we had a hit without a delay
- [ ] lookup how memory capacity correlates with latency, then implement memory delay based on the capacity parameter
- [ ] if received address is already being output, do nothing
- [ ] implement word writes and line writes etc. for refilling of caches
	- right now we can only do one byte write
- [ ] check parameter edge cases, small numbers and zeros, because it is a small design, we might have lots of those
- [ ] add more cache levels
- [ ] make reading async, writing sync
- [ ] rewrite testbench more elegently
- [ ] lookup write buffers
	- cache flushes entire lines at once to write buffer, then the write buffer at some point completes the writes to ram
