- [ ] add delay to [[cach hit]], we can't figure out that we had a hit without a delay
- [ ] lookup how memory capacity correlates with latency, then implement memory delay based on the capacity parameter
- [ ] if received address is already being output, do nothing
- [ ] implement word writes and line writes etc. for refilling of caches
	- right now we can only do one byte write
