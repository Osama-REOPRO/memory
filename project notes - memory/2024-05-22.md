- [ ] [[valToWrite]] is getting the wrong data, why?
- [ ] read_st is getting wrong value
- [ ] we are writing to the wrong address, while the address is 1, we write to 0
- [ ] [[valid_bytes]] is wrong, when 0 no valid bytes, but didn't notice because already 0
- [ ] is [[o_read_data]] being put where the valid byte is indicated?
- [ ] when writing, [[valid_bytes]] are being set moronically
- [ ] [[i_write_data]] is being assigned [[valToWrite]] without considering [[valid_bytes]]
- [ ] once address is 4 write data become 0 eternally
