- [x] [[valToWrite]] is getting the wrong data, why?
- [x] read_st is getting wrong value
- [x] we are writing to the wrong address, while the address is 1, we write to 0
- [x] [[valid_bytes]] is wrong, when 0 no valid bytes, but didn't notice because already 0
- [x] is [[o_read_data]] being put where the valid byte is indicated?
- [x] when writing, [[valid_bytes]] are being set moronically
- [x] [[i_write_data]] is being assigned [[valToWrite]] without considering [[valid_bytes]]
- [x] once address is 4 write data become 0 eternally
