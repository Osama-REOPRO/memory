- the cache / cache controller approach
	- we have a cache module that is responsible solely for the actual memory, it stores the data, it makes no decisions, it does what it is told, it reports it's internal state when prompted
	- a cache controller is a more opinionated wrapper for the cache, it decides how the cache should function
	- so the cache is the heart of the cache controller
