- [x] begin with word fetching, you write a byte, whole word fetched, set valid bit
- [[(decision)]] full word read-writes can be done within cache module, block read-writes are done sequentially by outside system
- [x] change testbench data sizes to be compatible with new cache input sizes
- [x] the problem right now is that I am writing in single bytes but mem isn't fetching the rest of the word, which means valid bit is never set, so all subsequent reads fail, fix that
- on write invalid word, report failure, request full word, only write byte if rest of word valid
	- outside system may first fill word with existing data, then do another write operation to write the new data to the byte it wants (that's what I'll do in my testbench)
- [x] after dirty replace why another write operation? 
- [x] [[evac_read_st]] should evacuate whole word not just byte
- [x] on conflict dirty replace, replace whole word, not just byte
- [x] on conflict read out word not byte
