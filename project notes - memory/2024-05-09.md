- [x] begin with word fetching, you write a byte, whole word fetched, set valid bit
- [[(decision)]] full word read-writes can be done within cache module, block read-writes are done sequentially by outside system
- [x] change testbench data sizes to be compatible with new cache input sizes
- [x] the problem right now is that I am writing in single bytes but mem isn't fetching the rest of the word, which means valid bit is never set, so all subsequent reads fail, fix that
- on write invalid word, report failure, request full word, only write byte if rest of word valid
	- outside system may first fill word with existing data, then do another write operation to write the new data to the byte it wants (that's what I'll do in my testbench)
- [x] after dirty replace why another write operation? 
- [x] [[evac_read_st]] should evacuate whole word not just byte
- [x] on conflict dirty replace, replace whole word, not just byte
- [x] on conflict read out word not byte
- [x] test different block sizes
- [ ] right now only words get evacuated, but valid bits are per set, so whole set should be evacuated then read later
- [ ] does cache read entire line at once? or only words at a time?
	- I guess it can do both and it is up to the designers
	- I am working with small numbers anyway, I think I should have it read whole lines at once
	> x86, MIPS and Motorola, the whole line gets written. This is because the cache line is the same as the bus width
	> I can't imagine any scenario in which a hardware architecture of any kind would do anything different, but I've been known to be wrong in the past.
	
- [[(decision)]] cache can read-write whole line (block) at a time
	- evacuations and replacements will be done one whole line at a time
