- [x] write testbench for simulation tests
- [x] [[empty_found]] never deasserted
- [x] after conflict, we are no longer reading, why?
	- we were not writing to tag mem so missed as soon as tag mem was no longer 0
- [x] on read fail, don't proceed, stop
- [x] write, then read from where you wrote, instead on incrementing address on write, increase on read
- [x] why does hit check fail once we cross over the address and warp to the beginning
	- wasn't writing to tag mem
- [x] why tag mem isn't written on write?

- âœ… directly mapped cache simulation verified

- [x] test different block sizes
- [ ] do we change input so it accepts whole block at once or do we write blocks one after another?
	- I think we should keep the caches themselves simple so outside system writes the different blocks one after the other rather than all at once
- [ ] force params to be powers of 2, snap up (ceil)
