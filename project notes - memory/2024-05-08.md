- [x] write testbench for simulation tests
- [x] [[empty_found]] never deasserted
- [ ] after conflict, we are no longer reading, why?
- [ ] on read fail, don't proceed, stop
- [ ] write, then read from where you wrote, instead on incrementing address on write, increase on read
- [ ] why does hit check fail once we cross over the address and warp to the beginning
- [ ] why tag mem isn't written on write?
