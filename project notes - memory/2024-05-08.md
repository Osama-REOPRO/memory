- [x] write testbench for simulation tests
- [x] [[empty_found]] never deasserted
- [x] after conflict, we are no longer reading, why?
	- we were not writing to tag mem so missed as soon as tag mem was no longer 0
- [x] on read fail, don't proceed, stop
- [x] write, then read from where you wrote, instead on incrementing address on write, increase on read
- [x] why does hit check fail once we cross over the address and warp to the beginning
	- wasn't writing to tag mem
- [x] why tag mem isn't written on write?

- âœ… directly mapped cache simulation verified

---

- [x] do we change input so it accepts whole block at once or do we write blocks one after another?
	- I think we should keep the caches themselves simple so outside system writes the different blocks one after the other rather than all at once
- [x] force params to be powers of 2, snap up (ceil)
- ~~[[(decision)]] there will be a valid bit for each byte within a word, because the memory is byte addressable~~
	~~- so if we write to a single byte, we want to know that byte is indeed valid~~
	- decided against this
- [[(decision)]] when write miss, write new value, made dirty, then fetch entire rest of block from memory
	- same thing on read, read miss, fetch not just missed value, but entire block containing it
	- this applies even in directly mapped cache, you write to byte, fetch entire word from memory (if it exists)
- [[(decision)]] memory is allocated before it is ever accessible
	- meaning that there is no such thing as having a miss and then looking up and not finding the value at all
	- you will always be able to set the valid bit
