- [x] add "allocate" and "deallocate" commands
	- decided against
- [x] on write if conflict and clean don't signal a conflict, just replace
- [x] on write conflict immediately return the conflict data to be evacuated
- [x] if no empty found, tell me if clean found
- [x] remove read/write states replace them with just togglable behavior
	- decided against doing this
- [[(code note)]] `#note0005`
	- skip lookup right to writing if we are replacing an evacuated block
	- this is important not just for a speed up, but when we lookup and conflict we choose a place to write at random, if we do another lookup then will change the random value, and replace a bit other than the one we actually replaced!
	- we want to preserve the previously found value of target_N
