- [ ] I am still using the addressing method used for writing bytes, that should be removed, the address should be read as is, from the outside we make sure to choose the correct valid bytes
- [ ] why the heck am I still filling it with zeroes every step! that makes no sense!
	- [ ] the reason for filling with zeroes previously is that I had nothing to fill the thing with
	- [ ] I should be pulling the rest of the missing data from upper memory
	- [ ] I try to write to a mem location, I don't get a hit, so I should first pull the rest of the data from up above, the write the new stuff on top
